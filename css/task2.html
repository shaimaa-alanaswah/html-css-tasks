      This lovable Rough Collie that's always getting into adventures and saving the day first appeared in a short story in 1939, but since then  appeared in novels, movies, TV shows and even video games! However, perhaps most known for the 19-season long TV show which aired from 1954 1973.
Six different canine actors played the part, but the longest reigning was a dog called Baby who starred from 1960 1966.Even up to the recent 40 years, Lassie has been re-envisioned by aTV Series and a 2005 full-length film being made about the famous Collie.

    Although Lassi character is female, the part has always been given to male Collies. The original was a Rough Collie named Pal. Since Pal died in 1958, all Lassie roles have been held by pups of his bloodline. It is reported that Pal made twice what his human co-star, Elizabeth Taylor, made in Lassie Come Home
